# ADQC: Adaptive Distributed Query Compiler

This is a reimplementation of the
[OGSA-DAI](http://www.ogsadai.org.uk/) query compiler in Clojure.

Work on this project up to 16th August 2010 was done as part of the
Google Summer of Code 2010, by Michał Marczyk, under the supervision
of Bartosz Dobrzelecki.

For future work on the project, see the [Assembla
space](http://assembla.com/spaces/adqc) or the [GitHub development
repository](http://github.com/michalmarczyk/adqc).

# Building

You will need [Leiningen](http://github.com/technomancy/leiningen), a
popular Clojure build tool.  See the file `project.clj` for details on
non-managed dependencies.
